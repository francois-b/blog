title: Setting up a blog with Webpack
location: Paris, France

After having tried several options, including Jekyll, I chose to go with a custom blog using React and Webpack. The goal was to write posts in Markdown —very much like you would with Jekyll— and use a custom Webpack loader to translate to HTML.

Among the several tricks to get right was adapting to Github Pages and deploying a single-page application. I found this to be very useful to handle routes in the frontend: https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages.

etc, etc...

To be continued!
